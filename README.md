# Talentpath Capstone Practice
Mini project to practice the basics of a Git &amp; GitHub workflow. 

## Getting Started:
* Clone this repository to your local machine
* Add a new markdown page for yourself
    * Create a branch for your work
    * Switch to that branch
    * Add a new file to the `team` folder. Name the file with your last name and a `.md` extension. For example: `mcfarland.md`
    * Add your name to the file
    * Save the file
* Create a GitHub Pull Request
    * Add and commit changes
    * Push to this repository
    * Issue a pull request and assign one of your other team members to perform "code review" and accept your pull request.

## Reviewing Code
You'll be assigned a pull request to review by one of your fellow students. 
* Go to GitHub and visit the repo for this project.
* Visit the Pull Request tab and click on the pull request you were assigned. Note the name of the branch.
* On your computer perform a `git fetch` to pull down the latest changes.
* Switch to the branch for that pull request.
* Open the other students file in your text editor. Did they add their name to the file? Hooray, their code has passed :)
* Go back to GitHub and accept the pull request and delete the other student's branch

## Handling issues
There are also a series of *issues* with this repo -- those are things that need to get done. In a real code project, these could be bugs that need fixing, features that need adding, or other tasks needed for the project. 

In this repo, we've put together issues to help you practice tackling issues in a code base. Your scrum master will give you more information when you're ready to tackle those.
